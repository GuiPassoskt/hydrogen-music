Hi everyone,

 

i'm happy to announce the final release of Hydrogen 0.9.6. I'm pretty sure that most of the users are already working with a 0.9.6-beta version, but here again is a small list of the most important changes in 0.9.6:

         * new build system (cmake)

         * add undo for song/pattern editor

         * jack-session support

         * jack-midi support

         * several bug fixes

         * tabbed interface

         * several small changes to the GUI

         * improve ExportSong add use of TimeLineBPM,

           RubberbandBatch processor and different types of resample interpolation

 

The release can be downloaded via github: https://github.com/hydrogen-music/hydrogen/archive/0.9.6.tar.gz

 

At this time, this is a linux-only release. Installers for Windows / OSX may follow in the future.

 

Big thanks to all those wonderful people who made this release happen and who are keeping this project alive!

 

Best regards,
