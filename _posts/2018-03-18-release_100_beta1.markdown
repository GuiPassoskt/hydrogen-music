The first beta release of Hydrogen 1.0.0-beta1 is now available.
It includes the following features:
- QT5 support
- Midi feedback
- OSC support (incl. feedback)
- Playback track
- Menu redesign
- Note probability property
- Velocity automation
- Full screen mode
- New default kit: GMRockKit

The source code and the binaries (for Windows) are available at [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hydrogen/files/Hydrogen/). Due to some last-minute problems with mxe and our build system the windows binaries are lacking jack and OSC support, but i hope this problem can be solved in a beta2 release.

As always, this release was a true community effort and made possible with the help of numerous people from all over the globe.
